\f0\fs26 \cf0 xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple input and output harddisk image formats. xmount creates a virtual file system using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a virtual representation of the input image. \
\
The virtual representation can be in raw DD, Apple's Disk Image format (DMG), VirtualBox's virtual disk file format (VDI), Microsoft's Virtual Hard Disk Image format (VHD) or in VmWare's VMDK file format. \
\
Input images can be raw DD, EWF (Expert Witness Compression Format) or AFF (Advanced Forensic Format) files. \
\
In addition, xmount also supports virtual write access to the output files that is redirected to a cache file. This makes it for example possible to boot acquired harddisk images using QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox, VmWare or alike.}]]>
