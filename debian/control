Description: Tool to crossmount between multiple input and output harddisk image files
 xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple input and output
 harddisk image types. xmount creates a virtual file system using FUSE
 (Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a virtual representation of the input
 image. The virtual representation can be in raw DD, Apple's Disk Image format (DMG),
 VirtualBox's virtual disk file format (VDI), VmWare's VMDK file format or Microsoft's
 Virtual Hard Disk Image format (VHD). Input images can be raw DD, EWF
 (Expert Witness Compression Format), AFF (Advanced Forensic Format v3 & v4),
 VDI (VirtualBox Virtual Disk Image) or QCOW (QEMU Copy On Write) files.
 In addition, xmount also supports virtual write access to the output files
 that is redirected to a cache file. This makes it possible to boot acquired
 harddisk images using QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox, VmWare or alike.
