xmount \- Tool to crossmount between multiple input and output harddisk image files

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B xmount
[[fopts] [mopts]] <ifile> [<ifile> [...]] <mntp>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B xmount
allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple input and output
harddisk image formats. xmount creates a virtual file system using FUSE
(Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a virtual representation of the input
image.

The virtual representation can be in raw DD, Apple's Disk Image format (DMG),
VirtualBox's virtual disk file format (VDI), Microsoft's Virtual Hard Disk
Image format (VHD) or in VmWare's VMDK file format.

Input images can be raw DD, EWF (Expert Witness Compression Format) or AFF
(Advanced Forensic Format) files.

In addition, xmount also supports virtual write access to the output files
that is redirected to a cache file. This makes it possible to boot acquired
harddisk images using QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox, VmWare or alike.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.B
fopts: (Options specific to FUSE)
  \-d: Enable FUSE's and xmount's debug mode.
  \-h: Display this help message.
  \-s: Run single threaded.
  \-o no_allow_other: Disable automatic addition of FUSE's allow_other option.
  \-o <fmopts> :
    Specify fuse mount options. Will also disable automatic addition of FUSE's
    allow_other option!
  INFO: For VMDK emulation, you have to uncomment "user_allow_other" in
        /etc/fuse.conf or run xmount as root.

.B
mopts: (Options specific to xmount)
  \-\-cache <file> :
    Enable virtual write support and set cachefile to use.
  \-\-in <type> :
    Specify input image type. Type can be "dd", "ewf", "aff".
  \-\-inopts <iopts> :
    Specify input library specific options.
  \-\-info :
    Print out some infos about used compiler and libraries.
  \-\-offset <off> :
    Move the output image data start <off> bytes into the input image.
  \-\-out <type> :
    Specify output image type. Type can be "dd", "dmg", "vdi", "vhd", "vmdk(s)".
  \-\-owcache <file> :
    Same as \-\-cache <file> but overwrites existing cache.
  \-\-rw <cache_file> :
    Same as \-\-cache.
  \-\-version :
    Same as \-\-info.
  INFO: Input and output image type defaults to "dd" if not specified.

.B
ifile:
  Input image file. If your input image is split into multiple files, you have
  to specify them all!
.br

.B
mntp:
  Mount point where virtual files should be located.

.B
iopts: (Options specific to input library)
  Some input libraries might support an own set of options to configure / tune
  their behaviour. If so, their options can be specified here as comma
  sepearated list of key=value pairs.

.SH "BUGS"
Hopefully none. If you find any, please e\-mail to <bugs@pinguin.lu>.

.SH "EXAMPLE"
To xmount an EWF image from your acquired disk as a raw DD image under /mnt,
use the following command:

  xmount \-\-in ewf ./acquired_disk.E?? /mnt

To xmount the same ewf image as vdi file, you would use a command like this:

  xmount \-\-in ewf \-\-out vdi ./acquired_disk.E?? /mnt

And to enable virtual write support on a raw DD input image xmounted as VDI
file:

  xmount \-\-out vdi --cache ./acquired_disk.cache ./acquired_disk.dd /mnt
