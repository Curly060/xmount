1.0 What is mountewf? - A short description
  mountewf is a small tool to mount ewf (Expert Witness Compression Format)
  files so that the contained data can be accessed directly by other programs
  without the need of supporting ewf input files. Data can be represented as
  dd image or as VirtualBox disk file.

2.0 A deeper view of things
  mountewf uses fuse (Filesystem in Userspace - http://fuse.sourceforge.net/)
  to export a filesystem containing an emulated representation of the original
  data contained in the ewf files. To access this data, mountewf uses libewf
  (Expert Witness Compression Format - https://www.uitwisselplatform.nl/projects
  /libewf/). This makes it possible to support all ewf versions supported by
  libewf. The emulated data representation can be either in raw dd format or it
  can be a VirtualBox virtual disk file. The two representations are explained
  in detail in the next two sections.

  2.1 Emulated dd file
    This is the standard data representation used by mountewf. It is a file
    containing the raw data contained in the ewf files. This makes it possible
    to access the raw data without uncompressing the whole ewf file before.
    Decompression is done on the fly while accessing the emulated dd file.

  2.2 Emulated vdi file
    When using the --vdi command line parameter, a VirtualBox disk file is
    emulated. This means that mountewf builds a virtual vdi header and prepends
    it to the raw data contained in the ewf files. The vdi file can be used in
    VirtualBox as a virtual disk file. This makes it possible to access the data
    from ewf files in your virtual machines.

3.0 Installation instructions
  To install mountewf, you can use a prebuild package for your distribution or
  you can build mountewf from source. The two methods are described in the two
  following sections.

  3.1 Prerequisits
    FUSE:
      Your linux distribution must support fuse and have the apropiate librarys
      installed. (See http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ for more informations). To be
      able to install from source, you also need the fuse header files.
    LIBEWF:
      You must have installed libewf. To install from source, you also need the
      libewf header files. (See https://www.uitwisselplatform.nl/projects/
      libewf/ for more informations)

  3.2 Install from a package
    If you are lucky, I provide a prebuild package for your linux distribution.
    In this case, you only have to fire up your distribution's package manager
    and install mountewf.

  3.3 Install from source
    After having checked the prerequisits, you should be able to compile and
    install mountewf by simply issuing the followng three commands:

    # ./configure
    # make
    # make install

4.0 mountewf command line parameters
  mountewf [[fuse_options] [--vdi] <image> <mountpoint>

  fuse_options:
    These are options specific to fuse. See the fuse docs for more infos.
  --vdi:
    Emulate a VirtualBox vdi file.
  image:
    Specifies the ewf file(s). You have to specify ALL ewf parts! Under bash,
    this can be done using .E?? as file extension.
  mountpoint:
    Specifies the mount point under which the emulated files will be located.

  4.1 mountewf usage examples
    To mount an ewf image from your acquired disk as an dd image under /mnt,
    you would use a command similiar to this:

    mountewf ./acquired_disk.E?? /mnt

    If you want to mount the same ewf image as vdi file, you would use
    a command like this:

    mountewf --vdi ./acquired_disk.E?? /mnt
